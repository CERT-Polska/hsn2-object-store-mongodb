Description: HSN2 Object Store Component (MongoDB).
 HSN2 Object Store is a central repository for all objects present in the system.
 It supports inserting new objects, getting and updating data of existing objects, 
 performing queries on all objects that belong to a given job. The current
 implementation uses MongoDB as it's backend database.
